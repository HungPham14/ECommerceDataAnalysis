MonetaryFeature
------------------------------------
Promotions and Discounts
Include: Promotions and discounts can provide valuable insights into customer behavior. They can help you understand how customers respond to different marketing strategies and how these strategies affect their purchasing patterns.

Adjust: You may want to adjust the monetary value to reflect the actual revenue generated after discounts. This can give you a more accurate picture of customer value.

Canceled Transactions
Exclude: Canceled transactions should generally be excluded from RFM analysis as they do not represent actual purchases. Including them could skew your results and lead to inaccurate conclusions.

Postage
Exclude: Postage costs are typically not part of the customer's purchasing behavior and do not reflect the value of the products purchased. Including postage could skew the monetary value.

Bank Charges
Exclude: Bank charges are not related to customer purchases and should be excluded from RFM analysis. They do not provide insights into customer behavior or value.

CRUK Commission
Exclude: Commission fees, such as those paid to third parties, should also be excluded. These fees do not represent customer spending and can distort the analysis.
